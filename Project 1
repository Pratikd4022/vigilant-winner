mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```

### **Prediction:**
```python
# Predict score for a student who studies 9.25 hours
hours = np.array([[9.25]])
predicted_score = model.predict(hours)
print(f"Predicted Score for 9.25 hours of study: {predicted_score[0]:.2f}")
```

### **Explanation:**
This project demonstrates the use of **Simple Linear Regression** to predict student scores based on their study hours.  
1. **Correlation:** A positive correlation exists between study hours and scores.  
2. **Model:** The linear regression model fit the data well, as evidenced by a high R-squared value.  
3. **Predictions:** The model can predict scores for new input values, making it a practical tool for educators and students.
